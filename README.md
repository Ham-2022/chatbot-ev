# ⚡ AI-Driven Intelligent Chatbot for Electric Vehicle (EV) Management

The transition to Electric Vehicles (EVs) is a critical step toward sustainable mobility. However, challenges such as **unplanned maintenance**, **battery health issues**, and **inefficient route planning** still persist.  

This project introduces a **Generative AI-Powered Chatbot** designed to tackle these problems using real-time analytics and intelligent automation — enhancing EV ownership, reducing costs, and increasing vehicle uptime and safety.
